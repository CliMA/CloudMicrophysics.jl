Traditionally, cloud ice microphysics schemes use various predefined  categories (such as ice, graupel, or hail) to represent ice modes, but the P3 scheme sidesteps the  problem of prescribing transitions between ice categories by adopting  a single ice category and evolving its properties.

The CI is the source of truth over local tests, and all tests must pass in the CI before code can be merged. See the Tests section below for debugging tips.\nCloudMicrophysics.jl has a small set of tests that are run on the GPUs using buildkite. They are triggered automatically when trying to merge a PR. If the GPU tests fail, check first for use of any \"out of place\" functions (for example, @warn will not work on GPU).\nThe Documentation / docbuild builds the documentation. Most common errors in the docbuild are related to missing docstrings, see the Documentation section for hints. This check may fail if the source code itself is not compiling, so please handle the compilation errors first. If the documentation build was successful, the documenter/deploy will display the documentation page based on the PR (click on the details).\nThe JuliaFormatter / format ensures consistent formatting throughout the repository. If this check fails, you can click on details to see which files are not following the formatting rules. You can apply the formatter by running julia --project=.dev .dev/climaformat.jl file_name in the terminal.

This option currently handles warm-rain processes including coalescence, condensation/evaporation, and sedimentation (terminal velocity). Unlike typical moment-based schemes which distinguish between categories such as rain and cloud, and which determine rates of conversion between categories (the canonical autoconversion, accretion, and self-collection), this option gives the user the flexibility to define as many or as few moments as they please, with these coalescence-based processes being solved directly without relying on conversion rates. Likewise, the rate of condensation/evaporation is defined through the rate of diffusion of water vapor to/from the surface of droplets defined by the subdistributions which underpin the method. The user has not only the flexibility to specify the number of moments (and therefore the complexity/accuracy) to use, but also the assumed size distributions corresponding to these moments. For instance, one might define a 5-moment implementation using an Exponential mode for smaller cloud droplets, plus a Gamma mode for larger rain droplets. Or, more creatively, perhaps a 12-moment implementation comprised of four Gamma modes.","category":"page"},{"location":"MicrophysicsFlexible/","page":"N-moment precipitation microphysics","title":"N-moment precipitation microphysics","text":"Options for dynamics and size distributions are under continuous development in the Cloudy.jl package, thus only the default and suggested use cases are described in detail here.","category":"page"},{"location":"MicrophysicsFlexible/#Moments-and-Sub-Distributions","page":"N-moment precipitation microphysics","title":"Moments and Sub-Distributions","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"MicrophysicsFlexible/","page":"N-moment precipitation microphysics","title":"N-moment precipitation microphysics","text":"The prognostic variables of this parameterization are a set of N moments, which can be further divided into P sets of moments, each of which correponds to a subdistribution p.
