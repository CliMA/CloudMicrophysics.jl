# AIDA Chamber Ice Nucleation Data
This artifact repackages ice nucleation data from the AIDA
aerosol and cloud simulation chamber at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology.
We use the time series of ice number density in each experiment to
calibrate our ice nucleation parameterization.

## Accessing the raw data
The raw data can be downloaded through ATMO-ACCESS from Eurochamp2020:
https://www.atmo-access.eu/virtual-access/#/
After logging in, data is found under "Data Curation of Homeless Data" -->
"Data Access" --> "ACTRiS" --> "Atomspheric Simulation Chamber". This should
bring the user to the EUROCHAMP2020 interface where AIDA chamber data can be found.

## Data details
The point of contact and author of the raw ice nucleation data
from the AIDA chamber is Ottmar Mohler. The homogeneous ice nucleation
data (IN05_17, IN05_18, IN05_19) includes a time series of pressure,
mean gas temperature, water partial pressure, total water concentration,
ice number density from WELAS, droplet number density, and droplet diameter.
The heterogeneous ice nucleation data (IN07_01, IN07_19) includes the same
first six variables, ice number density from FTIR, and ice water content.
These measurements were made during adiabatic expansion experiments in the AIDA chamber.
Experimental details can be found in Benz et al (2005) here:
