# Aerosol Nucleation

The `Nucleation.jl` currently contains parameterization
of binary ``H_{2}SO_{4}-H_{2}O`` nucleation, as described by [Vehkamaki2002](@cite).
This parameterization approximates theoretical nucleation values at a fraction of the computational cost.
The theoretical values are given by:
``` math
  J = Z \cdot \rho(1,2) \cdot \exp [\frac{-(W^{*}-W(1,2))}{kT}]
```
where ``œÅ(1, 2)`` and ``W(1, 2)`` are, respectively, the number
concentration and the formation energy of a sulfuric acid
dihydrate. ``W^{*}`` is the work needed to form the critical cluster, and Z is a kinetic pre-factor.

## Example of Aerosol Nucleation from Vehkamaki et. al 2002

The figures below have been reproduced from [Vehkamaki2002](@cite) using the
aerosol nucleation parameterization implemented in src/Nucleation.jl.
