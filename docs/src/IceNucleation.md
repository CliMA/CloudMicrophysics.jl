# Ice Nucleation

The `IceNucleation.jl` module includes
  the parameterization of activation of dust aerosol particles into ice crystals
  via deposition of water vapor and water activity based parameterization of immersion freezing.
These are heterogeneous ice nucleation processes.
The parameterization for deposition on dust particles is an implementation of
  the empirical formulae from [Mohler2006](@cite)
  and is valid for two types of dust particles:
  Arizona Test Dust and desert dust from Sahara.
  The parameterization for immersion freezing is an implementation of [KnopfAlpert2013](@cite)
  and is valid for droplets containing sulphuric acid.

!!! note

    Future work includes adding parameterizations
    for other nucleation paths such as
    heterogeneous immersion freezing or homogeneous freezing
    and modeling the competition between them.

## Activated fraction for deposition freezing on dust
The parameterization models the activated fraction
  as an empirical function of ice saturation ratio,
  see eq. (3) in [Mohler2006](@cite).
```math
\begin{equation}
f_i(S_i) = exp[a(S_i - S_0)] - 1
\end{equation}
```
where:
  - ``f_i`` is the activated fraction
      (the ratio of aerosol particles acting as ice nuclei to the total number of aerosol particles),
  - ``S_i`` is the ice saturation ratio
      (the ratio of water vapor partial pressure and the water vapor partial pressure at saturation over ice),
  - ``S_0`` is the threshold ice saturation ratio,
  - ``a`` is a scaling parameter dependent on aerosol properties and temperature.

Limited experimental values for the free parameters ``S_0`` and ``a`` can be found in [Mohler2006](@cite).
Both parameters are dependent on aerosol properties and temperature.

!!! note

    For a ``f_i`` values above 0.08 or ``S_i`` between 1.35 and 1.5,
    freezing occurs in a different ice nucleation mode
    (either a second deposition or other condensation type mode).

## ABIFM for Sulphuric Acid Containing Droplets
Water Activity-Based Immersion Freezing Model (ABFIM)
  is a method of parameterizing immersion freezing inspired by the time-dependent
  classical nucleation theory (CNT). More on CNT can be found in [Karthika2016](@cite).
  The nucleation rate coefficient, ``J``, describes the number of ice nuclei formed per unit area
  per unit time and can be determined by the water activity, ``a_w``. This parameterization follows
  [KnopfAlpert2013](@cite), [Koop2002](@cite), [MurphyKoop2005](@cite), and [Luo1995](@cite). In this model,
  aerosols are assumed to contain an insoluble and soluble material. When immersed in water,
  the soluble material diffuses into the liquid water to create a sulphuric acid solution.

Using empirical coefficients, ``m`` and ``c``, from [KnopfAlpert2013](@cite),
  the heterogeneous nucleation rate coefficient in units of ``cm^{-2}s^{-1}`` can be determined by the linear equation
```math
\begin{equation}
  log_{10}J_{het} = m \Delta a_w + c
\end{equation}
```
!!! note

    Our source code for the nucleation rate coefficient returns
    ``J`` in base SI units.

``\Delta a_w``is the difference between the water activity of the droplet, ``a_w``, and the water activity of ice at the same temperature, ``a_{w,ice}(T)``. From [Koop2002](@cite),
```math
\begin{equation}
  a_w = \frac{p_{sol}}{p_{sat}}
\end{equation}
```
```math
\begin{equation}
  a_{w,ice} = \frac{p_{i,sat}}{p_{sat}}
\end{equation}
```
where ``p_{sol}`` is saturated vapor pressure of water above solution, ``p_{sat}``
  is saturated vapor pressure above pure liquid water, and ``p_{i,sat}`` is saturated
  vapor pressure above ice. ``p_{sol}`` is determined in mbar using a parameterization
  for supercooled, binary ``H_2SO_4/H_2O`` solution from [Luo1995](@cite) which is valid for ``185K < T < 235K``:
```math
\begin{equation}
  ln(p_{sol}) = 23.306 - 5.3465x + 12xw_h - 8.19xw_h^2 + \frac{1}{T}(-5814 + 928.9x - 1876.7xw_h)
\end{equation}
```
where ``x`` is the weight fraction of sulphuric acid in the droplets
  (i.e. if droplets are 10% sulphuric acid by mass, ``x = 0.1``), ``w_h = 1.4408x``,
  and temperature is in Kelvins.

Once ``J_{het}`` is calculated, it can be used to determine the ice production rate, ``P_{ice}``, per second via immersion freezing.
```math
\begin{equation}
  P_{ice} = J_{het}A(N_{tot}-N_{ice})
\end{equation}
```
where ``A`` is surface area of an individual ice nuclei, ``N_{tot}`` is total number
  of ice nuclei, and ``N_{ice}`` is number of ice crystals already in the system.

## Homogeneous Freezing for Sulphuric Acid Containing Droplets
Homogeneous freezing occurs when supercooled liquid droplets freeze on their own.
  Closly based off [Koop2000](@cite), this parameterization determines a homoegneous nucleation
  rate coefficient, ``J_{hom}``, using water activity. The change in water activity,
  ``\Delta a_w(c,T,P)``, can be found in the same fashion that it is determined under the ABIFM
  section above. It is then used to empirically calculate ``J_{hom}(\Delta a_w)`` with units of
  ``cm^{-3}s^{-1}``.

The nucleation rate coefficient is determined with the cubic function from [Koop2000](@cite)
```math
\begin{equation}
  logJ_{hom} = -906.7 + 8502 \Delta a_w - 26924(\Delta a_w)^2 + 29180(\Delta a_w)^3
\end{equation}
```
This parameterization is valid only when ``0.26 < \Delta a_w < 0.36`` and ``185K < T < 235K``.
