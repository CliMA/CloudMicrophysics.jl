# P3 Scheme
TO DO: This is where P3 documentation will be.

overview, mention Microphysics2M, mention PSD is gamma function?

The `P3Scheme.jl` module implements the predicted particle properties
 (P3) scheme developed by [cite articles] for ice-phase microphysics.
 The P3 scheme is a 2-moment, bulk scheme involving a
 single ice-phase category with 4 degrees of freedom.

Traditionally, cloud ice microphysics models use various predefined categories to represent ice modes.

## m-D relationships

### small

### large unrimed

### partially rimed

### graupel

## Ice specific humidity
- (integral from 0 -> inf of m(D) times PSD dD)
