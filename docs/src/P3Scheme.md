# P3 Scheme

The `P3Scheme.jl` module implements the predicted particle properties
 (P3) scheme for ice-phase microphysics developed by [MorrisonMilbrandt2015](@cite).
The P3 scheme is a 2-moment, bulk scheme involving a
 single ice-phase category with 4 degrees of freedom: total mass,
 rime mass, rime volume, and number mixing ratios.
Traditionally, cloud ice microphysics schemes use various predefined
 categories (such as ice, graupel, or hail) to represent ice modes, but the P3 scheme sidesteps the
 problem of prescribing transitions between ice categories by adopting
 a single ice category and evolving its properties.
This simplification aids in attempts to constrain the scheme's free parameters.

The prognostic variables are:
 - ``N_{ice}`` - number concentration 1/m3
 - ``Q_{ice}`` - ice mass density kg/m3
 - ``Q_{rim}`` - rime mass density kg/m3
 - ``B_{rim}`` - rime volume - (volume of rime per total air volume: dimensionless)

    TODO - At some point we should switch to specific humidities...

## Assumed particle size relationships

The mass ``m`` and projected area ``A`` of particles
  as a function of maximum particle dimension ``D``
  are piecewise functions with variable thresholds described
  by the following table.

| particle properties                  |      condition(s)                            |    m(D) relation                             |    A(D) relation                                           |
|:-------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------|
|small, spherical ice                  | ``D < D_{th}``                               | ``\frac{\pi}{6} \rho_i \ D^3``               | ``\frac{\pi}{4} D^2``                                      |
|large, unrimed ice                    | ``Q_{rim} = 0`` and ``D > D_{th}``           | ``\alpha_{va} \ D^{\beta_{va}}``             | ``\gamma \ D^{\sigma}``                                    |
|dense nonspherical ice                | ``Q_{rim} > 0`` and ``D_{gr} > D > D_{th}``  | ``\alpha_{va} \ D^{\beta_{va}}``             | ``\gamma \ D^{\sigma}``                                    |
|graupel (completely rimed, spherical) | ``Q_{rim} > 0`` and ``D_{cr} > D > D_{gr}``  | ``\frac{\pi}{6} \rho_g \ D^3``               | ``\frac{\pi}{4} D^2``                                      |
|partially rimed ice                   | ``Q_{rim} > 0`` and ``D > D_{cr}``           | ``\frac{\alpha_{va}}{1-F_r} D^{\beta_{va}}`` | ``F_{r} \frac{\pi}{4} D^2 + (1-F_{r})\gamma \ D^{\sigma}`` |

where:
 - ``D_{th}``, ``D_{gr}``, ``D_{cr}`` are particle size thresholds in ``m``,
 - ``\rho_i`` is cloud ice density in ``kg m^{-3}``,
 - ``\beta_{va} = 1.9`` is a dimensionless parameter from [BrownFrancis1995](@cite) (based on measurements of vapor diffusion and aggregation in midlatitude cirrus),
 - ``\alpha_{va} = 7.38 \; 10^{-11} \; 10^{6 \beta_{va} - 3}`` in ``kg \; m^{-Î²_{va}}`` is a parameter modified for units from [BrownFrancis1995](@cite) in base SI units (also based on measurements of vapor diffusion and aggregation in midlatitude cirrus),
 - ``\rho_g`` is the bulk density of graupel in ``kg \; m^{-3}``
 - ``\gamma = 0.2285`` (``m^{2 - \sigma}``) where
 - ``\sigma = 1.88`` (dimensionless), both from the aggregates of side planes, columns, bullets, and planar polycrystals in [Mitchell1996](@cite).

The first threshold is solely determined by the free parameters:
  ``D_{th} = (\frac{\pi \rho_i}{6\alpha_{va}})^{\frac{1}{\beta_{va} - 3}}``.
The remaining thresholds: ``D_{gr}``, ``D_{cr}``, as well as the
  bulk density of graupel ``\rho_{g}``,
  and the bulk density of the unrimed part ``\rho_d``
  form a nonlinear system:
 - ``D_{gr} = (\frac{6\alpha_{va}}{\pi \rho_g})^{\frac{1}{3 - \beta_{va}}}``
 - ``D_{cr} = [ (\frac{1}{1-F_r}) \frac{6 \alpha_{va}}{\pi \rho_g} ]^{\frac{1}{3 - \beta_{va}}}``
 - ``\rho_g = \rho_r F_r + (1 - F_r) \rho_d``
 - ``\rho_d = \frac{6\alpha_{va}(D_{cr}^{\beta{va} \ - 2} - D_{gr}^{\beta{va} \ - 2})}{\pi \ (\beta_{va} \ - 2)(D_{cr}-D_{gr})}``
where
 - ``F_r = \frac{Q_{rim}}{Q_{ice}}`` is the rime mass fraction,
 - ``\rho_{r} = \frac{Q_{rim}}{B_{rim}}`` is the predicted rime density.

## Assumed particle size distribution

Following [MorrisonMilbrandt2015](@cite), the scheme assumes a
 gamma distribution for the concentration of ice particles per unit volume
 based on particle size measurements obtained by [Heymsfield2003](@cite)
 in tropical and midlatitude ice clouds and implemented by
 [MorrisonGrabowski2008](@cite):

```math
N'(D) = N_{0} D^\mu \, e^{-\lambda \, D}
```
where:
 - ``N'`` is the number concentration in ``m^{-4}``
 - ``D`` is the maximum particle dimension in ``m``,
 - ``N_0`` is the intercept parameter in ``m^{-5 - \mu }``,
 - ``\mu`` is the shape parameter (dimensionless),
 - ``\lambda`` is the slope parameter in ``m^{-1}``.

We assume ``\mu \ = 0.00191 \; \lambda \ ^{0.8} - 2``.
Following [MorrisonGrabowski2008](@cite) we limit ``\mu \ \in (0,6)``.
A negative ``\mu`` can occur only for very small mean particle sizes``\frac{1}{\lambda} < ~0.17 mm``.

The model predicted ice number concentration and ice mass density are defined as
```math
N_{ice} = \int_{0}^{\infty} \! N'(D) \mathrm{d}D
```
```math
Q_{ice} = \int_{0}^{\infty} \! m(D) N'(D) \mathrm{d}D
```

## Calculating shape parameters

As a next step we need to find the mapping between
  predicted moments of the size distribution ``N_{ice}`` and ``Q_{ice}``
  and the shape parameters ``\lambda`` and ``N_0``.
Solving for ``N_{ice}`` is relatively straightforward:
```math
N_{ice} = \int_{0}^{\infty} \! N'(D) \mathrm{d}D = \int_{0}^{\infty} \! N_{0} D^\mu \, e^{-\lambda \, D} \mathrm{d}D = N_{0} (\lambda \,^{-(\mu \, + 1)} \Gamma \,(1 + \mu \,))
```

``Q_{ice}`` depends on the variable mass-size relation ``m(D)`` defined above.
We solve for ``Q_{ice}`` in a piece-wise fashion defined by the same thresholds as ``m(D)``.
As a result ``Q_{ice}`` can be expressed as a sum of inclomplete gamma functions,
  and the shape parameters are found using iterative solver.

|:---------------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------|
| ``D < D_{th}``                               | ``\int_{0}^{D_{th}} \! \frac{\pi}{6} \rho_i \ D^3 N'(D) \mathrm{d}D``                    | ``\frac{\pi}{6} \rho_i N_0 \lambda \,^{-(\mu \, + 4)} (\Gamma \,(\mu \, + 4) - \Gamma \,(\mu \, + 4, \lambda \,D_{th}))``|
| ``Q_{rim} = 0`` and ``D > D_{th}``           | ``\int_{D_{th}}^{\infty} \! \alpha_{va} \ D^{\beta_{va}} N'(D) \mathrm{d}D``             | ``\alpha_{va} \ N_0 \lambda \,^{-(\mu \, + \beta_{va} \, + 1)} (\Gamma \,(\mu \, + \beta_{va} \, + 1, \lambda \,D_{th}))`` |
| ``Q_{rim} > 0`` and ``D_{gr} > D > D_{th}``  | ``\int_{D_{th}}^{D_{gr}} \! \alpha_{va} \ D^{\beta_{va}} N'(D) \mathrm{d}D``             | ``\alpha_{va} \ N_0 \lambda \,^{-(\mu \, + \beta_{va} \, + 1)} (\Gamma \,(\mu \, + \beta_{va} \, + 1, \lambda \,D_{th}) - \Gamma \,(\mu \, + \beta_{va} \, + 1, \lambda \,D_{gr}))`` |
| ``Q_{rim} > 0`` and ``D_{cr} > D > D_{gr}``  | ``\int_{D_{gr}}^{D_{cr}} \! \frac{\pi}{6} \rho_g \ D^3 N'(D) \mathrm{d}D``               | ``\frac{\pi}{6} \rho_g N_0 \lambda \,^{-(\mu \, + 4)} (\Gamma \,(\mu \, + 4, \lambda \,D_{gr}) - \Gamma \,(\mu \, + 4, \lambda \,D_{cr}))`` |
| ``Q_{rim} > 0`` and ``D > D_{cr}``           | ``\int_{D_{cr}}^{\infty} \! \frac{\alpha_{va}}{1-F_r} D^{\beta_{va}} N'(D) \mathrm{d}D`` | ``\frac{\alpha_{va}}{1-F_r} N_0 \lambda \,^{-(\mu \, + \beta_{va} \, + 1)} (\Gamma \,(\mu \, + \beta_{va} \, + 1, \lambda \,D_{cr}))``  |

where ``\Gamma \,(a, z) = \int_{z}^{\infty} \! t^{a - 1} e^{-t} \mathrm{d}D``
  and ``\Gamma \,(a) = \Gamma \,(a, 0)`` for simplicity.

In our solver, we approximate ``\mu`` from ``Q/N`` and keep it constant throughout the solving step.
We approximate ``\mu`` by an exponential function given by the ``Q/N`` points
  corresponding to ``\mu = 6`` and ``\mu = 0``.
This is shown below as well as how this affects the solvers ``\lambda`` solutions.

```@example
include("plots/P3LambdaErrorPlots.jl")
```
![](MuApprox.svg)

An initial guess for the non-linear solver is found by approximating the gamma functions
  as a simple linear function from ``x = \log{(Q/N)}`` to ``y = \log{(\lambda)}``.
The equation is given by ``(x - x_1) = A \; (y - y_1)`` where
  ``A = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{y_1 - y_2}``.
``y_1`` and ``y_2`` define ``log(\lambda)`` values for three ``Q/N`` ranges

|             Q/N                |         ``y_1``        |      ``y_2``         |
|:-------------------------------|:-----------------------|:---------------------|
|        ``Q/N >= 10^-8``        |         ``1``          |     ``6 * 10^3``     |
|   ``2 * 10^9 <= Q/N < 10^-8``  |     ``6 * 10^3``       |     ``3 * 10^4``     |
|        ``Q/N < 2 * 10^9``      |     ``4 * 10^4``       |       ``10^6``       |

We use this approximation to calculate initial guess for the shape parameter
  ``\lambda_g = \lambda_1 (\frac{Q}{Q_1})^{(\frac{y_1 - y_2}{x_1 - x_2})}``.

```@example
include("plots/P3ShapeSolverPlots.jl")
```
![](SolverInitialGuess.svg)

Using this approach we get the following relative errors for ``\lambda``

```@example
include("plots/P3LambdaErrorPlots.jl")
```
![](P3LambdaHeatmap.png)

## Terminal Velocity

We use the [Chen2022](@cite) velocity parametrization:
```math
V(D) = \phi^{\kappa} \sum_{i=1}^{j} \; a_i D^{b_i} e^{-c_i \; D}
```
where ``\phi = (16 \rho_{ice}^2 A(D)^3) / (9 \pi m(D)^2)`` is the aspect ratio,
and ``\kappa``, ``a_i``, ``b_i`` and ``c_i`` are the free parameters.

The mass-weighted fall speed (``V_m``) and the number-weighted fall speed (``V_n``) are calculated as
```math
V_m = \frac{\int_{0}^{\infty} \! V(D) m(D) N'(D) \mathrm{d}D}{\int_{0}^{\infty} \! m(D) N'(D) \mathrm{d}D}
```
```math
V_n = \frac{\int_{0}^{\infty} \! V(D) N'(D) \mathrm{d}D}{\int_{0}^{\infty} \! N'(D) \mathrm{d}D}
```

We also plot the mass-weighted mean particle size ``D_m`` which is given by:
```math
D_m = \frac{\int_{0}^{\infty} \! D m(D) N'(D) \mathrm{d}D}{\int_{0}^{\infty} \! m(D) N'(D) \mathrm{d}D}
```

Below w show these relationships for small, medium, and large ``D_m``
They can be compared with Figure 2 from [MorrisonMilbrandt2015](@cite).
```@example
include("plots/P3TerminalVelocityPlots_WithLiqFrac.jl")
```
![](MorrisonandMilbrandtFig2_0.0.svg)

## Collisions

Collisions are calculated through the following equation (see the 1-moment accretion documentation for discussion): 

```math 
\frac{dq_c}{dt} = \int_{0}^{\infty} \! \int_{0}^{\infty} \! \frac{E_{ci}}{\rho} \; N'_i(D_p) \; N'_c(D_c) \; A(D_i, D_c) \; m_{cld}(D_{cld}) \; |V_i(D_i) - V_c(D_c)| \; \mathrm{d}D_i \mathrm{d}D_c
```
 where:
  - ``i`` - denotes ice particles (either cloud ice or precipitating ice),
  - ``c`` - denotes colliding species (cloud liquid water on rain),
  - ``cld`` - denotes the species that are being collected during the collision event,
    (We assume that if the temperature is above freezing then ice particles get collected.
    In temperatures below freezing, cloud and rain particles are collected by the ice.),
  - ``E_{ci}`` - is the collision efficiency,
  - ``N'_x`` - is the particle distribution,
  - ``A`` - is the assumed crossection of the two colliding species,
  - ``m_x(D)`` - is the assumed particle mass as a function of it's size,
  - ``V_x(D)`` - is the assumed particle terminal velocity as a function of it's size.

!!! note
    TODO - In our parametrization we take ``E_ci = 1``

!!! note
    TODO - For now we assume ``A(D_i, D_c) = \pi \frac{(D_i + D_c)^2}{4}``.
    This is true for spherical particles only, we should be changing this according to the
    size regimes.

In order to compute the above integral,
  we need to know the particle size distributions of cloud and rain particles.
P3 scheme will be used with Seifert Beheng 2-moment warm rain microphysics
  [scheme](https://clima.github.io/CloudMicrophysics.jl/dev/Microphysics2M/#The-Seifert-and-Beheng-(2006)-parametrization).
  which assumes a Gamma distribution of cloud droplet mass and exponential distribution of rain drop mass.
Writing them as functions of droplet maximum dimension (meaning the diameter for spherical drops) we get:
  - cloud water: ``N_0 D^8 e^{-\lambda D^3}``
  - rain : ``N_0 e^{-\lambda D}``

  ``N_0`` and ``\lambda`` can be solved for respectively in each scheme through setting: 
  - ``N_c = \int_{0}^{\infty} N'_c(D) \mathrm{d}D`` 
  - ``Q_c = \int_{0}^{\infty} m_c(D) N'_c(D) \mathrm{d}D``
  where ``m_c(D)`` is the mass of particle of size D. Rain and cloud water particles are assumed to be spherical therefore, ``m_c(D) = \pi \rho_w \frac{D^3}{6}`` for both (``\rho_w`` = density of water). 

Collision rate comparisons between the P3 Scheme and the 1M microphysics scheme are shown below: 

```@example
include("plots/P3TendenciesSandbox.jl")
```
![](CollisionComparisons.svg)

## Melting 

Melting rates are calculated through the following equation: 

```math 
\frac{dQ}{dt} = \int_{0}^{\infty} \! \frac{dm(D)}{dt} N'(D) \mathrm{d}D
```

where: 
- ``\frac{dm(D)}{dt} = \frac{dm(D)}{dD} \frac{dD}{dt}``
- ``m(D)`` - mass of ice particle with maximum dimension D
- ``\frac{dD}{dt} = \frac{4}{D \rho_w} \frac{K_{thermo}}{L_f} (T - T_{freeze}) F(D)``
- ``F(D) = a + b N_{sc}^{\frac{1}{3}} N_{Re}(D)^{\frac{1}{2}}`` - ventilation factor
- ``N_{sc} = \frac{v_{air}}{D_{vapor}}`` - Schmidt number
- ``N_{Re}(D) = \frac{D V_{term}(D)}{v_{air}}`` - Reynolds number
- ``V_{term}(D)`` - terminal velocity of ice particle with maximum dimension D

!!! note
    TODO ``N_{Re}`` here is defined for spherical particles, we need to redefine it for non spherical particles too

with constant values: 
- ``\rho_a`` - density of air (1.2 kg / m^3)
- ``\rho_w`` - density of water (1000 kg / m^3)
- ``K_{thermo}`` - thermal conductivity of air 
- ``L_f`` - latent heat of freezing
- ``T_{freeze}`` - freezing temperature (273.15 K)
- ``v_{air}`` -  kinematic viscosity of air
- ``D_{vapor}`` - diffusivity of water
- ``a`` - 0.78 
- ``b`` - 0.308

Melting rate comparisons between the P3 Scheme and the 1M Microphysics scheme are shown below: 

![](MeltRateComparisons.svg)

## Heterogeneous Freezing 

Heterogeneous freezing rates are calculated using the ABIFM parametrization defined in the Ice Nucleation folder. Specifically, we use the following equation (taking into account the distribution of rain particles): 

```math 
\frac{dN}{dt} = \int_{0}^{\infty} \! J_{ABIFM} A(D) N'(D) \mathrm{d}D
```

```math
\frac{dQ}{dt} = \int_{0}^{\infty} \! J_{ABIFM} A(D) N'(D) m(D) \mathrm{d}D
```

where 
- ``J_{ABIFM}`` - calculated heterogeneous nucleation rate 
- ``A(D)`` - surface area of a particle with maximum dimension D (``\pi D^2`` in the case of spherical rain particles)
- ``N'(D)`` - number distribution of rain particles 
- ``m(D)`` - corresponding mass of a rain particle with dimension D 

The change in number concentration and mass due to heterogeneous freezing are shown below for 249K, 250K, and 251K.

## Liquid Fraction

To allow for the modeling of mixed-phase particles with P3, a new prognostic variable can be introduced:
  ``q_{liq}``, the mixing ratio of liquid on mixed-phase particles. As described in [Choletteetal2019](@cite),
  this addition to the framework of P3 opens the door to tracking the gradual melting (and refreezing) of a
  particle population with hydrometeor categories such as wet snow. Here, we describe the characteristics
  of the scheme with the addition of ``q_{liq}``.

Liquid fraction, analogous to ``F_r`` for rime, is defined ``F_{liq} = \frac{q_{liq}}{q_{ice}}``.
  Importantly, the introduction of ``q_{liq}`` changes the formulation of ``F_r``: whereas above,
  we have ``F_r = \frac{q_{rim}}{q_{ice}}``, we now need ``F_r = \frac{Q_{rim}}{q_{ice} - q_{liq}}``
  since the total ice mass ``q_{ice} = q_{rim} + q_{dep} + q_{liq}`` now includes liquid mass.

The addition of the liquid fraction does not change the thresholds ``D_{th}``, ``D_{gr}``, ``D_{cr}``,
  since the threshold regime depends only on ice core properties.

However, the assumed particle properties become ``F_{liq}``-weighted averages of particles' solid and liquid
  components:

```math
m(D, F_{liq}) = (1 - F_liq) * m(D, F_{liq} = 0) + F_liq * m_{liq}(D)
```
```math
A(D, F_{liq}) = (1 - F_liq) * A(D, F_{liq} = 0) + F_liq * A_{liq}(D)
```

where ``m_{liq}(D) = \frac{\pi}{6} \rho_liq * D^3`` and ``A_{liq}(D) = \frac{\pi}{4} D^2``.

When calculating shape parameters and integrating over the particle size distribution (PSD), it is important to
  keep in mind whether the desired moment of the PSD is tied only to ice (in which case we concern ourselves with the
  ice core diameter ``D_{core}``) or to the whole mixed-phase particle (in which case we need ``D_p``).

For the above particle properties and for terminal velocity, we use the PSD corresponding to the whole mixed-phase particle,
  so our terminal velocity of a mixed-phase particle is:

```math
V(D_{p}, F_{liq}) = (1 - F_{liq}) * V_{ice}(D_{p}) + F_{liq} * V_{rain}(D_{p})
```

We continue to use the terminal velocity parameterizations from [Chen2022](@cite) for rain, which
  is described [here](https://clima.github.io/CloudMicrophysics.jl/dev/Microphysics2M/#Terminal-Velocity).

For process rates that apply without liquid fraction, we now need to consider whether they are concerned with
  the ice core or the whole particle, in addition to whether they become sources
  and sinks of different prognostic variables. With the addition of liquid fraction, too,
  come new process rates.

...

To give an idea of how terminal velocity changes with nonzero liquid fraction,
  the above plots for terminal velocity are modified with
