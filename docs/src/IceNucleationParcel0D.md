# 0-dimensional adiabatic parcel model

The model solves for saturation ratio in a 0-dimensional
  adiabatic parcel raising with constant velocity.
It is based on [KorolevMazin2003](@cite), as well as the cirrus box model
  [Karcher2006](@cite), [Tully2023](@cite) and
  is meant as a sandbox for testing different nucleation schemes.

We define liquid saturation ratio ``S_l``
```math
\begin{equation}
S_l = \frac{e}{e_{sl}}
\end{equation}
```
where:
- ``e`` - is the partial pressure of water vapor,
- ``e_{sl}`` - is the partial pressure of water vapor at saturation over liquid water.
Note that some models, for example [KorolevMazin2003](@cite), denote ``S_l``
  to be supersaturation ``\frac{e}{e_{sl}} - 1``.

The change in saturation ratio can be described as
```math
\begin{equation}
\frac{dS_l}{dt} = \frac{1}{e_{sl}} \frac{de}{dt} - \frac{e}{e_{sl}^2} \frac{de_{sl}}{dt}
\end{equation}
```
From ideal gas law the partial pressure of water vapor can be written as
```math
\begin{equation}
e = q_v p \frac{R_v}{R_a}
\end{equation}
```
where:
- ``q_v`` is the water vapor specific humidity
- ``p`` is the air pressure
- ``R_v``, ``R_a`` are the gas constants for water vapor and air.

The change in partial pressure can be written as
```math
\begin{equation}
\frac{de}{dt} = \frac{dq_v}{dt} p \frac{R_v}{R_a} + q_v \frac{dp}{dt}\frac{R_v}{R_a}
\end{equation}
```

From the Clausiusâ€“Clapeyron relation
```math
\begin{equation}
\frac{de_{sl}}{dt} = \frac{L_v e_{sl}}{R_v T^2} \frac{dT}{dt}
\end{equation}
```
where:
- ``L_v`` is the latent heat of vaporization,
- ``T`` is the temperature.

From the moist adiabatic assumption
```math
\begin{equation}
\frac{dT}{dt} = \frac{R_a T}{c_p p} \frac{dp}{dt} + \frac{L_v}{c_p} \frac{dq_{l,vap}}{dt} + \frac{L_s}{c_p} \frac{d q_{i,subl}}{dt} + \frac{L_f}{c_p} \frac{d q_{i,fus}}{dt}
\end{equation}
```
where:
- ``q_{l,vap}`` is the cloud liquid water specific humidity from vaporization/condensation,
- ``q_{i,subl}`` is the cloud ice specific humidity from sublimation/deposition,
- ``q_{i,fus}`` is the cloud ice specific humidity from melting/freezing,
- ``L_s`` is the latent heat of sublimation,
- ``L_f`` is the latent heat of fusion.

From hydrostatic balance and assuming constant vertical velocity:
```math
\begin{equation}
\frac{dp}{dt} = -\frac{p g}{R_a T} w
\end{equation}
```
where:
- ``g`` is the gravitational acceleration
- ``w`` is the constant vertical velocity.

Accounting for conservation of water, i.e. ``\frac{dq_v}{dt} = - \frac{dq_{l,vap}}{dt} - \frac{dq_{i,subl}}{dt}``,
and rearranging the terms
```math
\begin{equation}
\frac{dS_l}{dt} = a_1 w S_l - \left(a_2 + a_3 \right)S_l  \frac{dq_{l,vap}}{dt} - \left(a_2 + a_4 \right) S_l \frac{dq_{i,subl}}{dt} - a_5 S_l \frac{dq_{i,fus}}{dt}
\end{equation}
```
where:
```math
\begin{equation}
a_1 = \frac{L_v g}{c_p T^2 R_v} - \frac{g}{R_a T}
\end{equation}
```
```math
\begin{equation}
a_2 = \frac{1}{q_v}
\end{equation}
```
```math
\begin{equation}
a_3 = \frac{L_v^2}{R_v T^2 c_p}
\end{equation}
```
```math
\begin{equation}
a_4 = \frac{L_v L_s}{R_v T^2 c_p}
\end{equation}
```
```math
\begin{equation}
a_5 = \frac{L_v L_f}{R_v T^2 c_p}
\end{equation}
```

Saturation ratio over ice can then be related to ``S_l`` by the relation
```math
\begin{equation}
  S_i = \xi S_l
  \label{eq:supersat_relation}
\end{equation}
```
where ``\xi = \frac{e_{sl}}{e_{si}}`` is the ratio of saturation vapor pressure over liquid and saturation vapor pressure over ice.

The crux of the problem is modeling the ``\frac{dq_l}{dt}`` and ``\frac{dq_i}{dt}``
  for different homogeneous and heterogeneous ice nucleation paths.

## Supported size distributions
Currently, the parcel model supports monodisperse, gamma, and lognormal size distributions. For
  monodisperse size distributions, the total mass is evenly distributed to all particles.
```math
\begin{equation}
  n(r) = N_{tot} \delta(r-\bar{r})
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  bar{r} = \left( \frac{3 \rho_a q_l}{4 \pi \rho_l N_{tot}} \right)^{1/3}
\end{equation}
```

For a gamma distribution of droplets, a free parameter, ``\lambda``, must be constrained.
  This can be done through relating the specific humidity and volume (assuming spherical
  droplets and crystals). The mean of ``r^3`` is found by dividing the third moment, ``M_3``, by the
  zeroth moment, ``M_0``. Once ``\lambda`` is found, we can use it to find the mean radius by
  dividing the first moment, ``M_1``, by the zeroth moment, ``M_0``.

```math
\begin{equation}
  n(r) = A \; r \; exp(-\lambda r)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  \bar{r} = \frac{M_1}{M_0} = \frac{2}{\lambda}
\end{equation}
```
where ``\lambda = \left(\frac{32 \pi N_{tot} \rho_l}{q_l \rho_a}\right)^{1/3}``.

A similar approach is used for the lognormal size distribution. We assume that the geometric
  standard deviation, ``\sigma_g``, is measured so that the only parameter that needs to be constrained is the median radius, ``r_m``.

```math
\begin{equation}
  n(r) = \frac{N_0}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \; \frac{1}{r \: ln(\sigma_g)} \; exp \left[ -frac{(ln(r)-ln(r_m))^2}{2 \: ln^2(\sigma_g)} \right]
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  \bar{r^3} = \frac{\rho_a}{\rho_w}\frac{3}{4\pi}\frac{q}{N} = \frac{M_3}{M_0} = r_m^3 exp \left( \frac{9}{2} ln^2(\sigma_g)\right)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  \bar{r} = \frac{M_1}{M_0} = r_m exp \left( \frac{1}{2} ln^2(\sigma_g)\right)
\end{equation}
```

## Condensation growth

The diffusional growth of individual cloud droplet is described by
([see discussion](https://clima.github.io/CloudMicrophysics.jl/dev/Microphysics1M/#Snow-autoconversion)),
```math
\begin{equation}
  r_l \frac{dr_l}{dt} = \frac{1}{\rho_l} \, (S_l - 1) \, G_l(T)
\end{equation}
```
where:
- ``r_l`` is the droplet radius
- ``\rho_l`` is the water density
- ``G_l(T) = \left(\frac{L_v}{KT} \left(\frac{L_v}{R_v T} - 1 \right) + \frac{R_v T}{e_{sl} D} \right)^{-1}``
    combines the effects of thermal conductivity and water diffusivity,
- ``K`` is the thermal conductivity of air,
- ``D`` is the diffusivity of water vapor.

!!! note
    Some formulations don't consider the ``-1`` term in the denominator of G(T)

Assuming spherical water droplets, the change in droplet mass ``m_l`` can be described as
```math
\begin{equation}
  \frac{dm_l}{dt} = 4 \pi \rho_l r^2 \frac{dr_l}{dt} = 4 \pi r_l (S_l - 1) G_l(T)
\end{equation}
```
Integrating over the assumed size distribution of droplets
```math
\begin{equation}
   \frac{dq_l}{dt} = \frac{1}{V} \frac{1}{\rho_a} 4 \pi (S_l - 1) G_l(T) \int_{0}^{\infty} n(r) r dr =
                                 \frac{1}{\rho_a} 4 \pi (S_l - 1) G_l(T) N_{tot} \bar{r}
\end{equation}
```
where:
- ``N_{tot}`` is the total number concentration of droplets per volume of air ``V``
- ``\bar{r}`` is their mean radius
- ``\rho_a`` is the density of air.

## Deposition growth

Similarly, for a case of a spherical ice particle growing through water vapor deposition
```math
\begin{equation}
  \frac{dm_i}{dt} = 4 \pi \, r_i \, \alpha_m \, (S_i - 1) \, G_i(T)
  \label{eq:massratesphere}
\end{equation}
```
where:
 - ``r_i`` is the ice particle radius,
 - ``\alpha_m`` is the accommodation coefficient that takes into account the fact that not all water vapor molecules
     that arrive at the particle surface will join the growing crystal,
 - ``G_i(T) = \left(\frac{L_s}{KT} \left(\frac{L_s}{R_v T} - 1 \right) + \frac{R_v T}{e_{si} D} \right)^{-1}``
     combines the effects of thermal conductivity and water diffusivity,

!!! note
    The ``r_i`` in eq. (\ref{eq:massratesphere})
    should be replaced by the capacitance ``C``,
    when considering non-spherical particles.
    For a sphere ``C=r``, for a circular disc ``C=2r/\pi``.

It follows that
```math
\begin{equation}
  \frac{dq_i}{dt} = \frac{1}{\rho_a} \alpha_m 4 \pi (S_i - 1) G_i(T) N_{act} \bar{r}
\end{equation}
```
where:
- ``N_{act}`` is the number of activated ice particles.

## Non-equilibrium condensation and deposition growth

We consider three different formations of non-equilibirum condensation and deposition growth, all of which only depend on $q$, the values of $q$ at saturation of equilibrium, and a relaxation timescale $\tau$ dependent on whether or not the particle is liquid or ice. The third formulation is derived from the second, but includes a time integrator.

### First simple version

Here, condensation/evaporation and deposition/sublimation is computed by comparing the current liquid/ice specific humidity to that at equilibrium, divided by the relaxation timescale of liquid/ice respectively. The condensation/evaporation equation is:

```math
\begin{equation}
    \left( \frac{d q_l}{dt} \right)_{cond} = \frac{q_l^{eq} - q_{l}}{\tau_l}
\end{equation}
```

where
- $q_l^{eq}$ is the liquid water specific humidity in equilibrium
- $q_l$ is the liquid specific humidity
- $\tau_l$ is the condensation relaxation timescale

and the deposition/sublimation equation is:

```math
\begin{equation}
    \left( \frac{d q_i}{dt} \right)_{dep} = \frac{q_i^{eq} - q_{i}}{\tau_i}
\end{equation}
```

where
- $q_i^{eq}$ is the ice specific humidity in equilibrium
- $q_i$ is the ice specific humidity
- $\tau_i$ is the deposition relaxation timescale

### Second simple version
In this case, we calculate condensation/evaporation and deposition/sublimation by comparing the water vapor specific humidity to that of liquid saturation or ice saturation, and dividing by the relaxation timescale of liquid/ice respectively. This formulation is derived from [morrison_modeling_2008](@cite) and [MorrisonMilbrandt2015](@cite), and is simply their version without imposing time integration.

!!! note
    The [morrison_modeling_2008](@cite) and [MorrisonMilbrandt2015](@cite) papers use mass mixing ratios, not specific humidities, which is what we use in the parcel model. That difference shouldn't affect these formulations themselves so long as specific humidity is used throughout.
    Addtionally, in their formulations they consider two different categories for liquid: cloud water and rain. Here, we consider them to be the same, and use a single relaxation timescale $\tau_l$ (liquid) rather than separate $\tau_c$ (cloud) and $\tau_r$ (rain) values.


The condensation/evaporation equation is:

```math
\begin{equation}
   \left( \frac{d q_l}{dt} \right) _{cond} = \frac{q_v - q_{sl}}{\tau_l \Gamma_l}
\end{equation}
```

where
- $q_v$ is the water specific humidity
- $q_{sl}$ is the liquid saturation specific humidity
- $\tau$ is the liquid relaxation timescale ** i think this shouldn't be c?
- $\Gamma_l$ is a psychometric correction due to latent heating/cooling:

```math
\begin{equation}
    \Gamma_l = 1 + \frac{L_{v}}{c_p} \frac{dq_{sl}}{dT}
\end{equation}
```

Similarly for deposition/sublimation:

```math
\begin{equation}
   \left( \frac{d q_i}{dt} \right) _{dep} = \frac{q_v - q_{si}}{\tau_i \Gamma_i}
\end{equation}
```

where
- $q_v$ is the water specific humidity
- $q_{si}$ is the liquid saturation specific humidity
- $\tau_i$ is the ice relaxation timescale
- $\Gamma_i$ is a psychometric correction due to latent heating/cooling:

```math
\begin{equation}
    \Gamma_i = 1 + \frac{L_{s}}{c_p} \frac{dq_{si}}{dT}
\end{equation}
```

### Time integrated version

Finally, we can calculate a time integrated version of our second formulation. Following Morrison and Milbrandt, we assume that the condensation/evaporation and deposition/sublimation over the course of the timestep can be calculated using the average difference between the $q_v$ value and those of saturation. Ie, they write:

```math
\begin{equation}
   \left( \frac{d q_l}{dt} \right) _{cond} = \frac{\bar{\delta_l}}{\tau_l \Gamma_l}
\end{equation}
```
where $\delta_l$ is defined as
```math
\begin{equation}
    \delta_l = q_v - q_{sl}
\end{equation}
```

The same can be done for deposition/sublimation:

```math
\begin{equation}
   \left( \frac{d q_i}{dt} \right) _{cond} = \frac{\bar{\delta_i}}{\tau_i \Gamma_i}
\end{equation}
```

where

```math
\begin{equation}
    \delta_i = q_v - q_{si}
\end{equation}
``

In order to calculate the $\bar{\delta}$ values, we consider the derivatives of delta:

```math
\begin{equation}
    \frac{d \delta}{dt} = \frac{dq_v}{dt} - \frac{dq_{s}}{dt}
\end{equation}
```

where we write out the derivatives as:

```math
 \begin{equation}
    \frac{d q_v}{dt} = - \frac{\delta}{\tau_c \Gamma_l}
 \end{equation}
```

```math
\begin{equation}
    \frac{d q_{sl}}{dt} = \frac{dq_{sl}}{dT} \frac{dT}{dt} + \frac{dq_{sl}}{dp} \frac{dp}{dt} = \frac{dq_{sl}}{dT} \frac{dT}{dt} + \frac{q_{sl} \rho_a g w}{p - e}
\end{equation}
```
where $\rho_a$ is the air density, $p$ is the air pressure, and $e$ is the saturation vapor pressure. This makes sense given the assumptions that $\frac{dp}{dt} = -\rho_a gw$ from hydrostatic balance, and $q_s = \frac{e_s}{p-e_s}$  for water vapor, where $e_s$ is the saturation water vapor pressure. Then $\frac{d q_s}{dp} = - \frac{e_s}{(p-e_s)^2} = - \frac{q_s}{p-e_s}$ .

and they write the change in temperature with time as:

```math
\begin{equation}
    \frac{dT}{dt} = - \frac{g w}{c_p} + \frac{L_v}{c_p} \frac{\delta}{\tau \Gamma}
\end{equation}
```

** which tau should the above equation have actually??

$\tau$: ** unsure if this should be here right now
```math
\begin{equation}
    \tau^{-1} = \tau_{l}^{-1} + \left( 1 + \frac{L_{s}}{c_p} \frac{dq_{sl}}{dT} \right) \frac{\tau_i^{-1}}{\Gamma_i}
\end{equation}
```

where

- $\tau_c$ is the time scale for cloud droplets
- $\tau_r$ is the timescale for rain droplets
- $\tau_i$ is the timescale for ice droplets
- $L_s$ is the latent heat of sublimation
- $c_p$ is the specific heat of air at constant pressure
- $T$ is temperature

so

```math
\begin{equation}
       \frac{d q_{sl}}{dt} = \frac{dq_{sl}}{dT} \left[- \frac{g w}{c_p} + \frac{L_v}{c_p} \frac{\delta}{\tau \Gamma} \right] + \frac{q_{sl} \rho_a g w}{p - e}
\end{equation}
```

!!! note
    we neglect terms due to radiation and mixing (included in the [morrison_modeling_2008](@cite) and [MorrisonMilbrandt2015](@cite) versions) in the parcel case.

Putting these back into the $\delta$ equations and rearranging based on the definitions of $\Gamma_l$ and $\Gamma_i$, we get:

```math
\begin{equation}
    \frac{d \delta_l}{dt} = \frac{- q_{sl} \rho_a g w}{p - e_{sl}} + \frac{gw}{c_p} \frac{dq_{sl}}{dT} - \frac{\delta_l}{\tau}
\end{equation}
```

and

```math
\begin{equation}
    \frac{ d \delta_i}{dt} = -\frac{q_{si} \rho_a g w}{p-e_{si}} + \frac{dq_{si}}{dT} \frac{gw}{c_p} - \frac{\delta_i}{\tau}
\end{equation}
```

If we assume that changes in $\frac{dq_s}{dT}$ and $\tau$ are small in comparison to their magnitudes, then we can approximate them as constant and both equations are linear differential equations with a solution of the form:

```math
\begin{equation}
    \delta (t) = A_c \tau + (\delta_{t=0} - A_c \tau) e^{-t/\tau}
\end{equation}
```

Then the $A_c$ values can be calculated based on the previous derivatives and by adding a term for the WBF process. *** need to try to explain where that term comes from although frankly i dont think its explained in their papers?

Condensation Ac:
```math
\begin{equation}
        A_c = - \frac{q_{sl} \rho g w}{p - e_s} + \frac{dq_{sl}}{dT} \frac{wg}{c_p} - \frac{(q_{sl} - q_{si})}{\tau_i \Gamma_i} \left( 1 + \frac{L_s}{c_p} \frac{dq_{sl}}{dT} \right)
\end{equation}
```

Deposition Ac:

```math
\begin{equation}
        A_{ci} = - \frac{q_{si} \rho g w}{p - e_s} + \frac{dq_{si}}{dT} \frac{wg}{c_p} + \frac{(q_{sl} - q_{si})}{\tau_i \Gamma_i} \left( 1 + \frac{L_s}{c_p} \frac{dq_{sl}}{dT} \right)
\end{equation}
```

Finally, to get the values for condensation/evaporation and deposition/sublimation over the timestep, we calculate the time average of $\delta$ by dividing by $\Delta t$ (the timestep) and then by the relaxation time as described in the above equations.

```math
\begin{equation}
    \left( \frac{d q_l}{dt} \right)_{cond} = \frac{A_c \tau}{\tau_i \Gamma_l} + (\delta_{t=0} - A_c \tau) \frac{\tau}{\Delta t \tau_i \Gamma_l} (1-e^{-\Delta t / \tau} )
\end{equation}
```

```math
\begin{equation}
    \left( \frac{d q_{si}}{dt} \right)_{dep} = A_c \frac{\tau}{\tau_i \Gamma_i} + (\delta_{t=0} - A_c \tau) \frac{\tau}{\Delta t \tau_i \Gamma_i} (1-e^{-\Delta t / \tau} ) + \frac{(q_{sl} - q_{si})}{\tau_i \Gamma_i}
\end{equation}
```

!!! note1
    In [MorrisonMilbrandt2015](@cite), they actually don't calculate a separate $\delta_i$ and instead calculate the deposition/sublimation rate through a correction to the condensation/evaporation rate such that:
    $$\left( \frac{d q_{si}}{dt} \right)_{dep} = A_c \frac{\tau}{\tau_i \Gamma_i} + (\delta_{t=0} - A_c \tau) \frac{\tau}{\Delta t \tau_i \Gamma_i} (1-e^{-\Delta t / \tau} ) + \frac{(q_{sl} - q_{si})}{\tau_i \Gamma_i}$$
    However, I found when I used just that correction, I was getting constant ice growth, even when ice wasn't supersaturated. I think it's possible that the correction term they've added,
    $$\frac{(q_{sl} - q_{si})}{\tau_i \Gamma_i}$$
    isn't correct because it would need to also be integrated over time (ie, they are considering the average values of $q_{sl}$ and $q_{si}$everywhere else but here.)

!!! note2
    The initial conditions I'm using right now probably don't make a lot of sense bc the supersaturation values are increasing so quickly. Need to look into that. I also need to implement limiters, as right now it is possible to have negative amounts of ice or liquid present.

## Deposition Nucleation on dust particles
There are multiple ways of running deposition nucleation in the parcel.
  `"MohlerAF_Deposition"` will trigger an activated fraction approach
  from [Mohler2006](@cite). `"MohlerRate_Deposition"` will trigger a
  nucleation rate approach from [Mohler2006](@cite). For both approaches,
  there is no nucleation if saturation over ice exceeds 1.35 as conditions
  above this value will result in nucleation in a different mode.
  `"ActivityBasedDeposition"` will trigger a water activity based approach
  from [Alpert2022](@cite). In this approach, ice production rate ``P_{ice, depo}``
  is calculated from
```math
\begin{equation}
  P_{ice, depo} = \left[ \frac{dN_i}{dt} \right]_{depo} = J_{depo}\;A_{aero}\;N_{aero}
  \label{eq:ActivityBasedDeposition_P_ice}
\end{equation}
```
where ``N_{areo}`` is total number of unactiviated ice nucleating particles and
  ``A_{aero}`` is surface area of those INP.
The deposition nucleation methods are parameterized as described in
  [Ice Nucleation](https://clima.github.io/CloudMicrophysics.jl/dev/IceNucleation/).

## Immersion Freezing
Following the water activity based immersion freezing model (ABIFM), the ABIFM derived
  nucleation rate coefficient, ``J_{immer}``, can be determined. The ice production rate,``P_{ice, immer}``,
  per second via immersion freezing can then be calculating using
```math
\begin{equation}
  P_{ice, immer} = \left[ \frac{dN_i}{dt} \right]_{immer} = J_{immer}\;A_{aero}(N_{liq})
  \label{eq:ABIFM_P_ice}
\end{equation}
```
where ``N_{liq}`` is total number of ice nuclei containing droplets and
  ``A_{aero}`` is surface area of the ice nucleating particle.

## Homogeneous Freezing
Homogeneous freezing follows the water-activity based model described in the
  [Ice Nucleation](https://clima.github.io/CloudMicrophysics.jl/dev/IceNucleation/) section which gives a nucleation rate coefficient of
  units ``cm^{-3}s^{-1}``.
The ice production rate from homogeneous freezing can then be determined:
```math
\begin{equation}
  P_{ice, hom} = \left[ \frac{dN_i}{dt} \right]_{hom} = J_{hom}V(N_{liq})
  \label{eq:hom_P_ice}
\end{equation}
```
where ``N_{liq}`` is total number of ice nuclei containing droplets and
  ``V`` is the volume of those droplets.

## Example figures

Here we show various example simulation results from the adiabatic parcel
  model. This includes examples with deposition nucleation on dust,
  liquid processes only, immersion freezing with condensation and deposition growth,
  and homogeneous freezing with deposition growth.

We start with deposition freezing on dust.
The model is run three times using the `"MohlerAF_Deposition"` approach
  for 30 minutes simulation time, (shown by three different colors on the plot).
Between each run the water vapor specific humidity is changed,
  while keeping all other state variables the same as at the last time step
  of the previous run.
The prescribed vertical velocity is equal to 3.5 cm/s.
Supersaturation is plotted for both liquid (solid lines) and ice (dashed lines).
The pale blue line uses the `"MohlerRate_Deposition"` approach.
  We only run it for the first GCM timestep because the rate approach requires
  the change in ice saturation over time. With the discontinuous jump in saturation,
  the parameterization is unable to determine a proper nucleation rate. When we force
  the initial ice crystal number concentration for this simulation to match
  that in the `"MohlerAF_Deposition"` approach, we obtain the same results as
  in the `"MohlerAF_Deposition"` approach for the first GCM timestep.

```@example
include("../../parcel/Example_Tully_et_al_2023.jl")
```
![](cirrus_box.svg)

The water activity based parameterization for deposition nucleation shows
  similar outcomes when compared to the `"MohlerRate_Deposition"` approach.
  Here, we run the parcel for 100 secs for all available aerosol types. The
  solid lines correspond to the `"MohlerRate_Deposition"` approach while the
  dashed lines correspond to `"ActivityBasedDeposition"`. Note that there
  is no common aerosol type between the two parameterizations.

```@example
include("../../parcel/Example_Deposition_Nucleation.jl")
```
![](deposition_nucleation.svg)

In the plots below, the parcel model is ran with only condensation (no ice or freezing)
  assuming either a monodisperse or a gamma distribution of droplets.
It is compared to [Rogers1975](@cite).

```@example
include("../../parcel/Example_Liquid_only.jl")
```
![](liquid_only_parcel.svg)

The plots below are the results of the adiabatic parcel model
  with immersion freezing, condensation growth, and deposition growth for
  both a monodisperse and gamma size distribution. Note that this has not
  yet been validated against literature. Results are very sensitive to
  initial conditions.

```@example
include("../../parcel/Example_Immersion_Freezing.jl")
```
![](immersion_freezing.svg)

The following plots show the parcel model running with homogeneous freezing and
  depositional growth assuming a lognormal distribution of aerosols.
  It is compared against [Jensen2022](@cite). Note that running with the initial
  conditions described in [Jensen2022](@cite) results in a ``\Delta a_w`` smaller
  than the minimum valid value for the ``J_{hom}`` parameterization. We have forced
  the ``\Delta a_w`` to be equal to the minimum valid value in this example only
  for demonstrative purposes.

```@example
include("../../parcel/Example_Jensen_et_al_2022.jl")
```
![](Jensen_et_al_2022.svg)

## P3 Ice Nucleation Parameterizations
The parcel also includes ice nucleation parameterizations used in
  the P3 scheme as described in [MorrisonMilbrandt2015](@cite).
  Deposition nucleation is based on the ice crystal number parameterization
  from Cooper (1986). The heterogeneous freezing parameterization, which
  follows Bigg(1953) with parameters from Barklie aand Gokhale (1959), is
  treated as immersion freezing in the parcel. Homogeneous freezing happens
  instantaneously at 233.15K.
Shown below are three separate parcel simulations for deposition nucleation,
  immersion freezing, and homogeneous freezing. Note that initial temperature
  varies for each run. The deposition nucleation run does not conserve
  INP number, while the other two freezing modes do. Updraft velocity is
  set to 0.5 m/s.

## Immersion Freezing Parametrization based on Frostenberg et al. 2023

Here we show the parcel model results when using the parametrization of immersion freezing
  based on [Frostenberg2023](@cite).
The concentration of ice nucleating particles (INPC) depends only on air temperature,
  and is based on a lognormal relative frequency distribution.
New ice crystals are created if the INPC exceeds the existing concentration of ice crystals,
  provided there are sufficient numbers of cloud liquid droplets to freeze.

Three different implementations of this parametrization are used in the parcel model:
- `mean` - in which INPC is equal to its mean value defined in [Frostenberg2023](@cite).
- `random` - in which INPC is sampled randomly from the distribution defined in [Frostenberg2023](@cite).
  The number of model time steps between sampling is set by `sampling_interval`.
- `stochastic` - in which INPC is solved for as a stochastic process,
  with the mean and standard deviation defined in [Frostenberg2023](@cite).
  The inverse timescale of the process is set by ``\gamma``.

The stochastic implementation is based on the [Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornsteinâ€“Uhlenbeck_process), 
in which the variable ``x`` is a mean-reverting process perturbed by Gaussian random noise (i.e. increments of the Wiener process ``W``):
```math
\begin{equation}
  dx = - \gamma(x - \mu)dt + \sqrt{2\gamma} \sigma dW; \quad\quad   dW \sim N(0, dt),
\end{equation}
```
where ``N`` is a zero-mean normal distribution with variance ``dt``.
For constant ``\gamma`` and ``\sigma``, and given some initial condition ``x(0)=x_0``, ``x`` has the analytical solution:
```math
\begin{equation}
  x(t) = 
      x_0 e^{-\gamma t} + \mu (1 - e^{-\gamma t})
    + \sqrt{2\gamma} \sigma \int_0^t e^{-\gamma(t-s)} dW,
\end{equation}
```
where ``\tau \equiv 1 / \gamma`` is the assumed timescale of the process. The process mean is ``x_0 e^{-\gamma t} + \mu (1 - e^{-\gamma t})``. We can calculate the variance ``\mathbb{V}(t)`` as,
```math
\begin{equation}
  \mathbb{V}(t) 
  = 2\gamma \sigma^2 \int_0^t e^{-2\gamma(t-s)} ds 
  = \frac{g^2}{2\gamma} \left( 1 - e^{-2\gamma t} \right).
\end{equation}
```

We use this process to model ``x=\log(\text{INPC})``, which tends toward a temperature-dependent mean value ``\mu(T)``.
The equation for ``\log(\text{INPC})`` is then,
```math
\begin{equation}
  d\log(\text{INPC}) = 
    - \frac{\log(\text{INPC}) - Î¼}{\tau} dt
    + \sigma \sqrt{\frac{2}{\tau}} dW
\end{equation}
```

This equation is currently implemented with the simple [Euler-Maruyama method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eulerâ€“Maruyama_method), which is the stochastic analog of the forward Euler method for (deterministic) ordinary differential equations, so that
```math
\begin{equation}
  \log(\text{INPC})_{t+dt} = \log(\text{INPC})_{t}
    - \gamma\left(\log(\text{INPC})_t - Î¼(T_t)\right) dt
    + \sigma \sqrt{2\gamma dt} z_t
\end{equation}
```
where ``z_t \sim N(0,1)`` is a standard normal random variable.

The following plot shows resuls of the parcel model with the `mean` (black line), `random` (dotted lines) and `stochastic` (solid lines) parameterization options.
We show results for two sampling intervals ``\Delta t`` (random), two process time scales ``\tau`` (stochastic), and two model time steps `dt`.
